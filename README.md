# Oscilloscope Art at Hackaday Supercon8 (2024)

This project is documented here:

https://hackaday.io/project/198922-oscilloscope-art-at-hackaday-supercon-8

This repo contains supporting schematics, code and spreadsheets (or at least that's the plan)

## Some notes from markusthegeekâ€‹:

Be sure to use the Earle Philhower library for the Pi Pico with the Arduino IDE.  You must press the boot button when powering the board to program it the first time when using the Arduino IDE.

When you clone the repo use the "sip-header-code" branch if you want to use it with the S8 Hackaday Badge
